# SSL

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your ssl certificate & key.
This directory is not a part of the standard Nuxt.js file structure.

Web-bluetooth applications requires serving secure pages (HTTPS), thus requires a cert + key pair.

Changes are made to nuxt.config.js according to [th Nuxt documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-server#example-using-https-configuration).

More information about development of web-bluetooth can be found in [this introduction article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web#https_only).
