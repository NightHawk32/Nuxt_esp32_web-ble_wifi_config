      This web app is intended for configuring WiFi credentials of headless IoT
      devices over Bluetooth LE.<br />
      Since the web-bluetooth specification is not finalized yet, only Google
      Chrome was validated to work on Mac OSX, Win 10, Android 9, and Ubuntu
      Linux (with some modifications).<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      To use or test this app you will need a ESP32 dev board which will run a
      matching application.
